Welcome to my Final Project Mr. Kwan. The following will provide an overview of how to navigate the program and how to use all the features.

<1> Inside the levels folder, you will find the layout for all 5 levels in their corresponding text file. You will also find the solutions file which has the exact level solutions if you ever get stuck on a level and don't want to spend too much time on it. It uses a specific notation which is explained in the file.

<2> Completion.txt is used to store your progress in the game and it saves all the levels that you have completed. This way you can close the program and come back to it later without losing your progress. You can also manually overide it yourself if you want to play around with different game states. 1's in the file represent levels that you have completed and 0's represent levels that you have not completed. When you first open the file, all the numbers should be 0's and there are numbers for as many levels that have been implemented (5 in this case). If you want to manually change a levels status to complete, replace its corresponding digit and ALL THE DIGITS TO ITS LEFT to 1's. (ex. Level 3 completed: 11100).

<3> When you first run the program, you will be brought to the main menu and you will have options to either play, read the instructions, or go to the level select menu.

<4> The level select menu lets you preview each level and it shows you whether the level is playable or locked. It will also show you which levels you have already completed. Once you select the  level you want to play, it will take you directly there.

<5> While in a level, you have the option to reset the level, or go back to the main menu any time. You can also hide the dots representing empty sapces on the grid to make it look cleaner. Rules on the objective of the game and how to play are found in the instructions menu and in game as well.

<6>Once you have completed a level, you will be directed to an in-between level menu. Here you will have the option to either replay the level, go back to the main menu, or procced to the next level.

<7> Once you have completed all the levels, you will be brought to the final screen where you can either go back to the main menu or exit the program.
